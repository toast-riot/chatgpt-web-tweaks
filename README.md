# ChatGPT Web Tweaks
This is a UserScript that makes some QOL changes to the UI and behaviour of the ChatGPT web interface.

**[Install the script](https://github.com/toast-riot/chatgpt-web-tweaks/raw/main/chatgpt_web_tweaks.user.js)**

### Usage
To learn how to use UserScripts, visit [this page](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts).

All of the configuration options and their options are at the top of the script.

**NOTE:** If you are using NoScript, make sure chatgpt.com has the `script`, `object`, `media`, `font` and `fetch` permissions.

### Features
- Block tracking and analytics requests
- Save 4o quota by using 3.5 for each message by default
- Use a custom tab title and icon (disguise the tab as something else)
- Hide useless elements (feedback buttons, "ChatGPT can make mistakes", etc.)
- Fix compliance issues (cookie consent, age verification, etc.)

### Troubleshooting
If the script is not working, or chatgpt.com is stuck on a blank page, it may be another extension interfering with it, such as NoScript or adblockers.
