- Add overrides for the returned models and categories to enable locked features?
- Bypass "this model does not support using tools" and not being able to use 3.5 in a chat with tools. Maybe use the model adding script to override the tools flags of gpt-3.5?
- Check if it is actually saving quota
- Make config use GM's config?
